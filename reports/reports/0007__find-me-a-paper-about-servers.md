### Result 2: Evaluation Report on MCP Servers - arXiv.org
- URL: https://arxiv.org/html/2504.11094v2
- Snippet: The outbreak of the MCP protocol has become a reality. To study the effectiveness and efficiency of MCP servers , we selected several widely used MCP servers and conducted an experiment to evaluate them using MCPBench on their accuracy, time, and token usage. We focused on two tasks: web search and database search.

## Answer

What I found:

- Evaluation Report on MCP Servers by Zhiling Luo and others acknowledges support from the Simons Foundation (arxiv.org/abs/2504.11094)
- The report evaluates several widely used MCP servers using MCPBench, focusing on web search and database search tasks to determine effectiveness and efficiency.
- The study aims to address two key questions:
  - Question 1: Are MCP Servers Effective and Efficient in Practice?
  - Question 2: Does MCP Provide Higher Accuracy Compared to Function Calls?

Therefore, the paper evaluates MCP servers based on their practical effectiveness and efficiency in specific application areas using a benchmark suite.
