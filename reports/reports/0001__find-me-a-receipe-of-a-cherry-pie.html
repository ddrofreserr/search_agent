<h2>Answer</h2>
<div class='card'>
<pre>What I found:

- Cherry pies are traditionally made with sour cherries rather than sweet cherries, though morello cherries are one of the most common kinds used.
- The first cherry pie recorded was baked for Elizabeth I.

Therefore, here is a simple recipe to make a homemade cherry pie: Use sour cherries and follow these basic steps - line your pie dish with phyllo or regular pastry dough, add the cherry filling (which may include sugar, lemon juice, and sometimes cornstarch), cover it with a lattice top crust, bake until golden brown, and serve warm.

Therefore, based on the Wikipedia information, sour cherries are recommended for making traditional cherry pies, as evidenced by the sources provided. Additionally, historical records indicate that such pies were enjoyed as early as Elizabeth I's time.</pre>
